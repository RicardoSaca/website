## My Personal Website

This repository holds the code to my personal website. 

During this project I have taught myself to use:
 * Flask (flask-mail, flask-login, flask-admin, flask-sqlalchemy, and Blueprints) for web development
 * Git for code management
 * Heroku for deployment
 * HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for front end development 
 * sql-alchemy, and postgres for database management  

My website, like myself, is still a work in progress. I will continue to improve it and add projects as I learn.
