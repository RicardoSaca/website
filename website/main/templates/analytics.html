            Here is a Matplotlib animation that shows the trajectory of my reading habits.
            On the right, there is a line chart that depicts the number of books read each month since 2019.
            On the left, there is a total of the books I read each year.
            You can also notice that I have surpassed my reading goal for 2021.
